# Buffering of imports for convenient stepwise script execution #

`It is frequent the case that we have to execute some commands in small pieces in order to gain better advantages of scripting.`

`In this case we should use ` **`import buffering`** `in order to avoid selecting repeatedly the necessary import statements.`

`The ` **`Imports`** `menu of the rsyntaxArea based GroovyLab's programmer's editor permits to buffer some import statements by selecting them and using the` **`Buffer selected imports`** `submenu choice. Then these statements are automatically executed before any script.`

`We can clear the buffered imports using` **`Clear buffered imports`** `and we can display the buffer of selected imports with` **`the Display current buffered imports`** `choice.`
