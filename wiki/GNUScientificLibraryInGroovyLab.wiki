#summary MATLAB-like inteface of GNU Scientific Library in GroovyLab.

= Introduction =

`GroovyLab utilizes the project:`

https://github.com/bytedeco/javacpp-presets/tree/master/gsl

`in order to provide MATLAB-like access to the powerful GNU scientific library.`

`We provide some examples.`

== `Example 1` ==


{{{
  x = 5.6

  y = gsl_sf_bessel_J1(x)  // use the GSL library

}}}
 
== `Example 2 ` ==
