# Introduction #
`This page describes useful convenience features of GroovyLab as they are added, and with the date stamp of their implementation.`

## `Reading information from Libraries for code completion (July 27 - 2012) ` ##

`This feature works with the RSyntaxArea based editor of GroovyLab.`

`From the "Completion" menu we can load using Java reflection information concerning Classes and Methods for various libraries, e.g. EJML, MTJ, JLAPACK, Numerical Recipes, NUMAL, Apache Commons etc.`

`Then, we can use that information with the CTRL-SPACE code completion feature of the RSyntaxArea editor.`
